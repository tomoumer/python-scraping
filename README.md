# Web Scraping with Python Code Samples

I have forked this repository from the original author <a href='https://github.com/tomoumer/python-scraping/commits?author=REMitchell'>Ryan Mitchell</a>. I am working through the book which was just updated to the <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Web-Scraping-Python-Extraction-Modern/dp/1098145356/ref=sr_1_1?crid=26L260MB9EEZW&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.I4tMMcExZzKzNO7POlqFd2mSjfqaQwEQqnRyCqa5l4hV5fyEkfhbJr5BVZTM-ZwNFgVnfx46YaoAIOwA0EENZrMCeofaoftno7HtCxAsFA_o9a-SXJbnRiCUbrZwKrtKfC1USXyuKf4ugyQUIwkxFPQrhmKsxmyspqoDSLHt4UOokJxHS9tG_IKp_YRq87IecdwvbMeeoUXQTDMKkEhNcQjTrXzQFIBwL3OnNk1nm7Y.rS2rn2zVgrM-xM-Nd1tyn2kfOOyIjwNrjqvpwaJJBsU&dib_tag=se&keywords=web+scraping+with+python%2C+3rd+edition&qid=1712501779&sprefix=web+scraping+%2Caps%2C96&sr=8-1'>3rd edition</a> and annotating/editing the jupyter notebooks with my own comments.

These code samples are for the book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920078067.do">Web Scraping with Python 2nd Edition</a>

If you're looking for the first edition code files, they can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/REMitchell/python-scraping/tree/master/v1">v1</a> directory.

Most code for the second edition is contained in <a href="https://jupyter.org/install.html">Jupyter notebooks</a>. Although these files can be viewed directly in your browser in Github, some formatting changes and oddities may occur. I recommend that you clone the repository, install Jupyter, and view them locally for the best experience.

The web changes, libraries update, and make mistakes and typos more frequently than I'd like to admit! If you think you've spotted an error, please feel free to make a pull request against this repository.
